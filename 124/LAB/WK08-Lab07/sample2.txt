     ssu ma chien gives the following biography of sun tzu     
  
       sun tzu wu was a native of the ch`i state.  his art of
  war brought him to the notice of ho lu     king of wu  ho
  lu said to him    i have carefully perused your  chapters
  may i submit your theory of managing soldiers to a slight
  test  
       sun tzu replied    you may 
       ho lu asked    may the test be applied to women  
       the answer was again in the affirmative  so arrangements
  were made to bring  ladies out of the palace  sun tzu
  divided them into two companies  and placed one of the king s
  favorite concubines at the head of each  he then bade them
  all take spears in their hands  and addressed them thus     i
  presume you know the difference between front and back  right
  hand and left hand  
       the girls replied   yes
       sun tzu went on    when i say  eyes front    you must
  look straight ahead  when i say  left turn   you must face
  towards your left hand  when i say  right turn    you must
  face towards your right hand  when i say  about turn    you
  must face right round towards your back 
       again the girls assented  the words of command having
  been thus explained  he set up the halberds and battle axes
  in order to begin the drill  then  to the sound of drums  he
  gave the order  right turn   but the girls only burst out
  laughing  sun tzu said    if words of command are not clear
  and distinct  if orders are not thoroughly understood  then
  the general is to blame 
       so he started drilling them again  and this time gave
  the order  left turn   whereupon the girls once more burst
  into fits of laughter  sun tzu    if words of command are
  not clear and distinct  if orders are not thoroughly
  understood  the general is to blame  but if his orders are
  clear  and the soldiers nevertheless disobey  then it is the
  fault of their officers 
       so saying  he ordered the leaders of the two companies
  to be beheaded  now the king of wu was watching the scene
  from the top of a raised pavilion  and when he saw that his
  favorite concubines were about to be executed  he was greatly
  alarmed and hurriedly sent down the following message     we
  are now quite satisfied as to our general s ability to handle
  troops  if we are bereft of these two concubines  our meat
  and drink will lose their savor  it is our wish that they
  shall not be beheaded 
       sun tzu replied    having once received his majesty s
  commission to be the general of his forces  there are certain
  commands of his majesty which  acting in that capacity  i am
  unable to accept 
       accordingly   he had the two leaders beheaded   and
  straightway installed the pair next in order as leaders in
  their place  when this had been done  the drum was sounded
  for the drill once more  and the girls went through all the
  evolutions  turning to the right or to the left  marching
  ahead or wheeling back  kneeling or standing  with perfect
  accuracy and precision  not venturing to utter a sound  then
  sun tzu sent a messenger to the king saying    your soldiers 
  sire  are now properly drilled and disciplined  and ready for
  your majesty s inspection  they can be put to any use that
  their sovereign may desire  bid them go through fire and
  water  and they will not disobey 
       but the king replied    let our general cease drilling
  and return to camp  as for us  we have no wish to come down
  and inspect the troops 
       thereupon sun tzu said    the king is only fond of
  words  and cannot translate them into deeds 
       after that  ho lu saw that sun tzu was one who knew how
  to handle an army  and finally appointed him general  in the
  west  he defeated the chu state and forced his way into
  ying  the capital  to the north he put fear into the states
  of chi and chin  and spread his fame abroad amongst the
  feudal princes  and sun tzu shared in the might of the king
     about sun tzu himself this is all that ssu-ma ch`ien has to
tell us in this chapter  but he proceeds to give a biography of
his descendant   sun pin  born about a hundred years after his
famous ancestor s death  and also the outstanding military genius
of his time  the historian speaks of him too as sun tzu  and in
his preface we read    sun tzu had his feet cut off and yet
continued to discuss the art of war      it seems likely  then 
that   pin  was a nickname bestowed on him after his mutilation 
unless the story was invented in order to account for the name
the crowning incident of his career  the crushing defeat of his
treacherous rival pang chuan  will be found briefly related in
